### 阅读笔记

#### 2004 Rostra

+ a framework to detect equivalent object states and redundant tests.
+ has five techiniques

***

##### Page2



"To determine redundant tests, our techniques dynami

cally monitor test executions. Each execution consists of

transitions on the state of the Java program."



" Our

framework considers *redundant* tests: a test is redundant for

a test suite if every method execution of the test is equiva

lent to some method execution of some test from the suite"

***

##### method sequences

"Our method-sequence approach allows the tests to contain loops, arithmetic, aliasing, and/or polymorphism."

***

##### 测试软件选择

11 Java classes. Some used by previous researchers, some are examples given by Junit/ Jtest. 

***

#### 2018 FAST

提到了Test Case Proioritization的概念

##### Prioritization criteria

+ early: based on code coverage
+ recently: black-box criteria based on system models, on requirements, or on historical failure data

***

##### What's new

+ exploit data mining algorithms for similarity-based testing of big testsets.
+ existing similarity-based approaches do not scale up to big testsets. 

***

##### 测试软件选择

Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository (Open Source)

several programs, in sequential versions, each containing a different number of seeded faults

***



#### 2009 Test Redundancy measurement

+ metrics for coverage based measurement of test redundancy
+ evaluate using two Java projects

##### 

Based on different coverage criterions, a test case can be viewed as redundant/ not redundant. 

***

##### 测试软件选择

open-source Java

Test framework/ tools; Biological program; Game framework

***

**To achieve a more reliable** 

**(precise) form of redundancy measurement, one needs** 

**to consider all types of coverage criteria.** 



#### 1998 effects of minimization

"test suite minimization techniques could reduce the ability of that test suite to reveal faults in the software"
